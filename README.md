# Flowforge 
### A Rust Command-Line Tool for Automated Project Understanding

---

##  Overview

Flowforge is a Rust-based command-line tool designed to help developers and students quickly understand new or unfamiliar software projects.

When joining a new project, developers often struggle to understand:
- Project structure
- File responsibilities
- Entry points
- Configuration files

Flowforge solves this problem by automating project exploration through a CLI interface and an AI-style explanation agent.
